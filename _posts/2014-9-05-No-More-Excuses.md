title: No More Excuses
---

In this internet age, the rise of blogs is no news. News blogs, tech blogs, fashion blogs, gossip blogs and the likes are all over the net. Today, I begin my journey in joining the ranks of professional blog writers worldwide.

So here comes the big question, 

> What is your excuse for just starting now?

Over the years, I have experimented with different blogging platforms and my reasons for not sticking to them are explained below.

###Wordpress
Without a doubt, [Wordpress][1] is the **defacto** when it comes to blogging on the internet. I couldn't bring my self to use it because of two major reasons.

1. To do any serious customization, you will need to write [php][2]. As a developer, I am always picky about the tools I use and try to avoid [php][2] as much as possible. My dislike for the language is a personal bias. The syntax is just plain weird and I couldn't bring my self to love the language.

2. The added cost involved in finding a web host to host your blog. Don't get me wrong, [Wordpress][1] can be hosted for free but it does come with some limitations like sticking to their `.wordpress.com` domain. Switching to a custom domain either requires extra payment per month using their platform or finding a web host to host your blog. 

###Blogger
1. Achieving satistactory customization with [Blogger][3] is a big feat. 

___

My criteria for choosing a blogging platform are based on the following points

* Simplicity
* Less Configuration
* Hackable
* Free hosting


After much searching for the **perfect** blogging platform, I finally discovered [Jekyll][4] and [Jekyll Now][5]. It brings simplicity to setting up a blog in a way like never before and best of all, it can be hosted for free on [Github Pages][6]. 

There is no need to begin explaining the process of setting [Jekyll Now][5] as there are articles that do justice to that, especially the [one][8] written by [Barry Clark][7]. 

Every serious software developer needs a presence online. with [Jekyll][4] and [Jekyll Now][5], no excuses not to have one.
